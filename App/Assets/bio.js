module.exports = 'Hi! I\'m Austin--a full stack JavaScript developer living in Austin, Texas. I spent most of my twenties as a Peace Corps volunteer and teacher in North, West and East Africa. I met a lot of interesting folks, ate a ton of good food and studied a number of languages. On a whim, started to teach myself another language--JavaScript. Got hooked on programming and haven\'t looked back since. I recently completed a software immersive and am now looking for a dev team to call my own.\n I am ramped up on modern JS front and backend frameworks and comfortable navigating the full stack. I am also open to relocation opportunities.\nOutside of development, I love my pets, am an occassional runner and a connoisseur of all things fried. Get in touch and let\'s build something!'
